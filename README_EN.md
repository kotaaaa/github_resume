## **Objective**

I am Software Developer with 2.5 years' experience in the E-Commerce industry. I am mainly involved in the back-end development of item inventory management and order transfer, but also in the front-end and infrastructure areas. I am also well versed in operational tasks such as load tests and parameter tuning of middleware such as Nginx, and Kubernetes. In graduate school, I was engaged in research on data mining using natural language processing. I was selected as a JASSO scholarship recipient for exemption from repayment for my achievements during my studies, including external presentations at peer-reviewed international conferences. Currently, I would like to get an opportunity to work as a backend engineer to work on new product development.
